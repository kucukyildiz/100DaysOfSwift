# ⚡️Day 10 – Classes and inheritance

In the first 15 days of the **100 Days of Swift** course, I discover the basics of Swift language on Xcode Playgrounds. Here are the topics I learned today:

1. Creating your own classes
2. Class inheritance
3. Overriding methods
4. Final classes
5. Copying objects
6. Deinitializers
7. Mutability
