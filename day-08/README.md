# ⚡️Day 8 – Structs, properties, and methods

In the first 15 days of the **100 Days of Swift** course, I discover the basics of Swift language on Xcode Playgrounds. Here are the topics I learned today:

1. Creating your own structs
2. Computed properties
3. Property observers
4. Methods
5. Mutating methods
6. Properties and methods of strings
7. Properties and methods of arrays
