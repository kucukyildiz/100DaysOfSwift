# ⚡️Day 7 - Closures, part two

In the first 15 days of the **100 Days of Swift** course, I discover the basics of Swift language on Xcode Playgrounds. Here are the topics I learned today:

1. Using closures as parameters when they accept parameters
2. Using closures as parameters when they return values
3. Shorthand parameter names
4. Closures with multiple parameters
5. Returning closures from functions
6. Capturing values
