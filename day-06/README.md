# ⚡️Day 6 – Closures part one

In the first 15 days of the **100 Days of Swift** course, I discover the basics of Swift language on Xcode Playgrounds. Here are the topics I learned today:

1. Creating basic closures
2. Accepting parameters in a closure
3. Returning values from a closure
4. Closures as parameters
5. Trailing closure syntax
